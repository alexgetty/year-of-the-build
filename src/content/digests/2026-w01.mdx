## Welcome to Year of the Build

Hello, world!

Well, since this is my first post and I'm not inheriting a large online following, let me address my likely audience: Hello, mom!

Welcome to Year of the Build—my experiment in publicly and epically burning myself out making as many cool things as I possibly can in the year of our Claude, 2026.

Some of these will be commercial products I hope to profit from. Others will be passion projects, fun experiments, or open source tools for the community. I've intentionally avoided planning everything upfront so I can respond to trends and opportunities as the year unfolds.

### What to Expect

- **Devlogs** documenting progress as I build. I'll share project details, talk through challenges and wins, and occasionally dive deeper into interesting technical or design topics.
- **Multiple concurrent projects** at any given time. I have a lot of interests and get bored easily. I'll launch fast, learn fast, and move on if an idea isn't gaining traction. Nothing is precious except product-market fit. Sorry, Gollum.
- **Honest retrospectives.** What worked, what didn't, what I'd do differently. I was the 5-year-old who got upset when his parents didn't honestly critique his artwork, and I've carried that expectation of critique with me since. I won't shy away from admitting or even dissecting my mistakes if it can help others.
- **A weekly digest newsletter** summarizing the week's progress for those who prefer email.

### What not to Expect

- **Tutorials:** In the age of AI, who's reading tutorials? I want to focus our time together on higher-level ideas rather than how to implement something with a certain tech stack.
- **"Premium" Content:** I'm sharing all of this for free, and you will never have to pay a cent to read any content I produce here. I highly doubt anyone would pay for this drivel anyway.
- **Hustle porn:** No cringy 4am wake-up routines, no "grindset" content, no glamorizing burnout (even though I joked about it above). This shit is played out and looks so, so desperate.
- **A polished personal brand.** I'm not an influencer and have no interest in "cultivating a personal brand". This is a build log mostly to keep myself on track, not a content marketing strategy.
- **Consistency:** I already told you I get bored. Some weeks will be dense, others... less so. I won't post filler just to hit a cadence.

## Who Am I?

I'm a designer, programmer, and artist who's been building random shit for about 25 years. I've always loved making stuff—tinkering, prototyping, starting things. But I've also always been a generalist. A jack of all trades, master of some. That breadth meant I could never dive deep enough into any single discipline to ship the ambitious projects I had in my head.

Then agentic coding happened.

Over the past few months, I've been learning to work with AI coding agents—tools like Claude Code that can handle the grunt work while I focus on architecture, design, and direction. Suddenly, my generalist brain isn't a liability. I can sketch a system, describe the intent, and collaborate with an AI to build it in a fraction of the time it would have taken me alone.

I know how to code. Everything I build here, I COULD build myself, it would just take me exponentially longer. This isn't vibe coding, it's AI-enhanced building. (and yes, I used an LLMism there on purpose, these logs will be human-written, always)

This has awakened something in me. A fiery, almost desperate passion to build as many of my old ideas (and new ones) as I possibly can.

## The Prep Work

I didn't want to start 2026 empty-handed. Here's what I built in the months leading up to launch:

### Mythical — *Launched Jan 1, 2026*
A scheduling app that lives inside your Google Calendar. No new dashboard to learn—just connect and start accepting bookings. Freemium positioning against overpriced competitors like Calendly. Four weeks from zero to MVP.

### The Construct — *In Progress*
A themeable React component library that treats motion, responsiveness, and flexibility as foundational. I'll use this to build as many of my projects as I can and continue to build out my component library and utilities. For now, this is internal, but I'd happily open source this if there is interest.

### TRKR — *In Progress*
A personal activity tracker, journal, and time capsule. Automated data collection reduces the need for manual entry. The idea: awareness alone changes behavior. By seeing your patterns laid bare in data, you naturally align your actions with your goals. Local-first, no cloud dependency, full data ownership.

### This Site
The Year of the Build website itself—Astro, MDX, content collections, newsletter pipeline. Not super exciting, but kinda necessary, don't you think?

## What's on the Horizon?

I have a few more projects in various stages of ideation:

- **Combatting disinformation on the web.** A browser extension that uses a bring-your-own-API-key model to let people detect logical fallacies and misinformation on the web.
- **Sousi:** An AI-powered sous-chef that proactively does your meal planning and grocery shopping to make home cooking as convenient as delivery at a fraction of the cost.
- Other stuff I'm not ready to talk about yet (because I haven't thought of it yet).

## How to Follow Along

- **Subscribe to the newsletter** for weekly digests
- **Check back here** for the full devlogs
- **Follow me on Github.** I don't do social media, so this is all you get.

Let's see how this goes...
