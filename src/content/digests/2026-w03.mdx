No new projects this week. Just cleaning up the mess I made while sprinting to get things out the door. The kind of work that doesn't make for exciting devlogs but keeps everything from collapsing under its own weight.

## Personal Blog

The blog went from "working but messy" to "working but less messy." Frontend housekeeping that should've happened during the build but didn't. The codebase is now smaller and actually maintainable. Ready for content. I guess I'm done procrastinating on finishing all those article drafts...

## YOTB

Everything links to everything now. Projects show their devlogs, devlogs show their digests, digests show their devlogs. Also added proper image handling with lightboxes and sidebar figures.

## GettyNet

Built a visitor counter for Slop Bucket, which validated GettyNet as shared infrastructure across projects. One backend to rule them all.

## What's Next

Back to building. Mythical has a testing reckoning coming, and I may have accidentally started another project. More on that next week.
