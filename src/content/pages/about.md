Year of the Build started as a call to action for myself: stop tinkering in private and actually ship things. I've spent years experimenting and building side projects and never releasing them. It's time to commit to putting stuff out into the world.

In the nascent age of agentic coding, the game is changing. The barrier to entry has never been lower, but that means the threshold for quality has never been higher. One person can now take an idea and ship it in a fraction of the time it would have taken an entire team just a few years ago. For people like me who've spent their lives developing a "jack of all trades" skillset, this is incredibly empowering.

But, as Uncle Ben once said, "with great power comes great responsibility." I want to lay down some ground rules, both for myself and to set expectations with you, my readers and potential users.

## Human Authorship
A lot of people are skeptical of content on the web because so much of it is AI-generated. Writing forces you to think through what you're saying and AI allows you skip that vital step. So here's my promise:

All content on this site will be authored by me. My thoughts, my words, my voice. I may use AI to explore ideas, generate outlines, paraphrase ramblings, or proofread, but the final ideas and words will always be written by me.

## Technical Ownership
While I'm not a formally trained software engineer, I've been teaching myself to code since Dreamweaver was still owned by Macromedia (circa 2004). I'll never be the most competent engineer, and I lack production experience, but I have a decent foundation. Most importantly, I know when I don't know something, and I'm committed to learning (and sharing it) before vibe coding my projects into oblivion.

I review all code changes. I make all architectural decisions. I regularly jump into the codebase and make sweeping edits myself. I'm not reliant on AI — I use it to move quicker, not to do things I couldn't do myself. I will never ship something I don't understand.

## A Force for Good
I care deeply about the wellbeing and future of humanity and this planet. I hold myself to high standards, even when I can't keep them. And I refuse to sell out my values to make a quick buck.

This philosophy will carry through into everything I build here. My time and energy go toward things that provide real value to real people. They will be honest, ethical, and meaningful. Whenever practical, I'll give things away for free. When I do charge, expect generous free tiers and fair pricing.
