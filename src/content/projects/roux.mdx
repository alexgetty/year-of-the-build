Roux turns a folder of interconnected markdown files into a queryable knowledge graph. It's the bridge between human-editable notes (like an Obsidian vault) and AI-powered semantic operations. And that's just the 3-day proof of concept.

### The Architecture

Provider-based design with a central orchestration hub:

- **GraphCore** routes requests to pluggable providers (store, embedding, vector, LLM)
- **DocStore** reads markdown, extracts frontmatter and wiki-links, builds the graph
- **TransformersEmbeddingProvider** generates embeddings locally (no external API calls)
- **MCP Server** exposes 10 tools for search, traversal, CRUD, and hub detection

SQLite caches derived data only. Delete the cache, rebuild from source files. No migration anxiety.

### Design Decisions Worth Noting

**Local embeddings by default.** Uses transformers.js to generate vectors without calling OpenAI or any external service. Privacy-first, works offline.

**IDs from file paths.** Node IDs derive from relative paths (lowercase), enabling Obsidian compatibility. Future: frontmatter-based ID overrides for migration scenarios.

**Graceful degradation everywhere.** Missing providers don't crash the system. Features just become unavailable. Partial functionality beats total failure.

### What's Next

MVP is complete. Now it needs real-world usage to find the sharp edges. Planned: alternative storage backends (Neo4j, FalkorDB), REST API, non-markdown format support.
