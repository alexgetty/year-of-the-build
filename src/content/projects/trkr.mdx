## About TRKR

During the trial which ultimately led to his death sentence, Socrates is known for saying "The unexamined life is not worth living." He believed that without introspection, self-reflection, and questioning one's beliefs, one cannot find true meaning or value in their existence. He chose death instead of an exile void of this opportunity.

While I don't plan to die for this project, I do share the affinity for self-awareness and self-reflection. I've also always been kind of a nerd for a good chart.
  
My final project in college was a data visualization project that involved tracking what I did every hour of every day for a few months, then creating 3-dimensional, almost sculptural representations of the data I collected.

Today, that project has evolved into TRKR, a personal activity/habit tracker, journal, and time capsule. The driving principle behind this tool is that awareness alone can change behavior, even devoid of any intentional use of willpower. By seeing your patterns laid bare in data, it drives you to better align your actions with your goals without having to make a conscious plan to do so.

### The Build
Electron + React with TypeScript. Electron-vite for development, electron-builder for distribution. D3.js for visualizations. Tailwind for styling, Zustand for the lightweight state that React components need.

Storage is deliberately low-tech: ~/Documents/TRKR/metrics/timeline.json. No cloud store, no corporate server with your personal data. It's just a file on your computer.

All data sources are normalized and formatted into a singular timeline data structure. Every time-based metric becomes a segment with start/end timestamps. Screen time from macOS knowledgeC.db arrives as screen segments. Google Fit minute-level data collapses into active segments. Idle detection creates idle segments. Sleep inference produces sleep segments based on time of day and lack of both physical activity and screen activity, but can be manually adjusted later.

My bet is that as more automatic data sources are added, more and more will be able to be inferred, even without direct data integrations.

### What's Working
- Automated, multi-source data collection with no manual actions needed.
- Consolidated visualizations show daily activity, habits, and routines.
- Integrated journaling allows an optional qualitative side to the quantitative record.


### What's Next
- More data sources
- Better journaling experience
- Custom self-moderating habit tracker: your steady performance in current/past habits determines your ability to introduce new habits to track, ensuring you don't overload yourself with unsustainable change.
