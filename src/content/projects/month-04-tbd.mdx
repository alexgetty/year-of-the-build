## Project Details

This project is in planning phase. The idea: connect your GitHub repo and get a no-holds-barred code review from AI.

### Concept

- Analyze repo structure, naming conventions, code patterns
- Generate a "roast score" with specific callouts
- Provide actionable improvement suggestions
- Shareable roast cards for social media

### Why Tauri + Rust?

Experimenting with desktop apps this month. Tauri gives us tiny binaries and native performance. Plus, I want to get better at Rust.

### Goals

- Launch by end of April
- Public repo on GitHub
- Posted to r/programming and Hacker News
- Product Hunt launch
