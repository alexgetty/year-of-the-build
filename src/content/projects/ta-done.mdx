ta-done (ta-da + done) is an Electron app that automatically discovers Git repos on your machine, displays them in a sidebar, and lets you manage tasks on a Kanban board. The twist: each task can spawn a tabbed terminal window with a Claude agent to work on it.

### The Idea

Integrated task lists with coding agents isn't a novel concept — there are other tools in this space. But I started building this for myself, found it useful, and think there's room for different approaches. So I'm continuing development.

### Architecture

The local app architecture enables some interesting patterns:
- Spawn multiple terminal tabs, each with its own Claude session
- Activity monitoring alerts you when Claude finishes and needs a new prompt
- Task list integration via MCP server — Claude can add todos automatically

### Current State

This started as a tinkering project in 2025, so there's no devlog history of its development. It's still rough — I don't use it daily yet. Stability work is needed before it becomes a reliable part of my workflow.

Development resumes now, and I'll document progress as I go.
