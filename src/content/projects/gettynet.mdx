GettyNet is my personal server infrastructure, a place to run API endpoints and collect data from third-party services that my local applications can then pull from.

This isn't a public product. It's plumbing. As I tinker with new ideas, there are things I can't do locally or need a persistent service for. GettyNet is that service.

### Current Usage

Right now it's only serving one purpose: an API endpoint for TRKR to collect data that can't be gathered locally. But the infrastructure is there for future integrations as needs arise.

### Why Document It?

Even though this isn't a product, it's still a project I'm maintaining. Documenting the work keeps me accountable and might be useful for others setting up similar personal infrastructure.
