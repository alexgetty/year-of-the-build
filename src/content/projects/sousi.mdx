Delivery apps have turned dinner into a $35 guilt subscription. Everyone knows it's expensive and unsatisfying, but they keep doing it because the alternative—figuring out what to cook ahead of time, buying ingredients, actually making the thing—requires decisions when you're already depleted.

The real problem isn't that people don't want to cook. It's that meal planning is cognitive overhead at the worst possible time. If Sousi can absorb that overhead, home cooking becomes the path of least resistance instead of the chore you're avoiding.

Sousi handles everything but the fun parts:
1. Weekly personalized meal plans are proactively sent to your phone. Set preferences, budget, kitchen time, equipment, etc.
2. Grocery lists are automatic and optimized. Recipes or plan may be tweaked based on what's available and in what quantities to prevent waste and stay on budget.
3. One-tap grocery delivery with price comparison between local delivery options.
4. Step-by-step cooking instructions. Will learn your timing and better estimate recipe times in the future.

Free for users. Revenue comes from grocery affiliate commissions—which means the unit economics only work if people stick around. Meal kit margins are brutal; traditional meal planning apps charge subscriptions for what amounts to a DIY recipe database.

Delivery pains are the hook. The sinker is multi-member household meal planning. Multiple dietary restrictions, changing preferences, little prep time, lots of variety... that's a lot on top of everything else. Sousi will be able to handle all that for you. The market has been begging to give money to someone who can do this right, but it's really hard, and no one has delivered yet.
