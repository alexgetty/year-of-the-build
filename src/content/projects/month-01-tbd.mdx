## About Mythical

Mythical started as an experiment in generative AI combined with procedural content. The idea was simple: what if you could create entirely unique mythological creatures at the click of a button?

Each creature gets a name, origin story, special abilities, weaknesses, and a visual representation. The AI generates the lore while a custom algorithm creates the visual design using SVG patterns and color palettes.

### The Build

The project taught me a lot about prompt engineering, rate limiting, and building delightful user experiences around AI features. The biggest challenge was making each creature feel genuinely unique while maintaining consistent quality.

### What Worked

- The share functionality drove organic growth
- Weekly challenges created recurring engagement
- The visual generator was more popular than expected

### What I'd Do Differently

- Start with a simpler MVP
- Add user accounts from day one
- Build the community features earlier
