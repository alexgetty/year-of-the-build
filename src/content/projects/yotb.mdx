The Year of the Build website and newsletter infrastructure. Built with Astro, MDX content collections, and a manual Beehiiv pipeline for weekly digests.

## What It Is

A public build log documenting progress across all projects throughout 2026. Not a polished personal brand—just honest documentation of what's being built, what works, and what doesn't.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Astro (static site, islands architecture)
- **Components:** React (hydrated only when interactive)
- **Content:** MDX (Markdown + JSX components)
- **Newsletter:** Beehiiv (free tier, manual send)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
