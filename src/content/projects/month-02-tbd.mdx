## Project Details

Pocket Greenhouse is currently in active development. The core plant tracking functionality is working, and I'm now focused on the notification system and onboarding flow.

### Current Progress

- Basic plant CRUD operations
- Watering schedule logic
- Initial UI components
- Supabase auth integration

### This Week's Focus

Building out the reminder notification system. The tricky part is handling timezone-aware scheduling that actually feels helpful rather than annoying.

### Goals

- Launch by end of February
- Public repo on GitHub
- Posted to r/plantclinic and r/houseplants
- Product Hunt launch
