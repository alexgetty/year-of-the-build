## Project Details

Focus Blocks is next in the queue. The concept: a time-blocking app that's actually pleasant to use, with smooth drag-and-drop and satisfying visual feedback.

### Initial Ideas

- Canvas-based block rendering for smooth 60fps interactions
- Color-coded categories with automatic contrast
- Weekly and daily views with seamless transitions
- Calendar sync (Google, Apple)

### Research Phase

Currently exploring:
- How other time-blocking tools handle recurring events
- Best practices for drag-and-drop accessibility
- SvelteKit's form actions for optimistic updates

### Goals

- Launch by end of March
- Public repo on GitHub
- Posted to r/productivity
- Product Hunt launch
