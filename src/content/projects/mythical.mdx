  Mythical is a scheduling app that lives inside your Google Calendar. No new dashboard to learn, no complex workflows—just connect and start accepting bookings.

  ### The Pitch
  Calendly charges $10/month for features most people don't need while gatekeeping ones they do. Mythical offers unlimited calendars (from any account), event types, and bookings for free.

  ### The Build
  Next.js 16 with React 19, PostgreSQL via Prisma, real-time Google Calendar webhooks for instant availability updates. The booking page theming system supports animated backgrounds (shader-based), custom fonts via Google Fonts, and adaptive color schemes.

  ### What Works
  - Freemium positioning (hopefully) resonates with people paying for bloated features with overpriced competitors
  - The theme customization with animated backgrounds is unique among peers
  - No-signup booking flow keeps friction low for guests
  - The inherent viral sharing model of the platform encourages organic growth with low CAC

  ### What I'd Do Differently
  - Add Outlook/Apple Calendar support earlier. Or at least have done more research into all of them before setting up just Google. I'm worried I've made one-way door decisions that won't scale to multiple calendar providers easily.
  - Validate more, launch sooner. I didn't even have a landing page until the MVP was complete.


  ### Lasting Legacy: Optimistic UI
  I wanted Mythical to feel smooth and responsive. Loading times kill conversion. Jagged reloads break flow.
  Every interaction in Mythical is optimistic by default. Click a button, see the result. The API call happens in the background—if it fails, we roll back and tell you.
  This wasn't a performance optimization bolted on later, it was a foundational rule from day one: **assume success, handle failure gracefully**. The pattern forced better architecture decisions—local state that can roll back, API responses designed for reconciliation, UI that lets the user get on with it.
  The discipline required to build this way—and the quality of experience it produces—became the primary inspiration for [the Construct](/projects/the-construct), a design system and component library that bakes optimistic UI and motion into its DNA. While Mythical itself isn't built on this system (yet), I plan to use it as the UI layer for as many of this year's projects as I can.
