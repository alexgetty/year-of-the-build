## About Slop Bucket

I was testing my personal blog's design with fake articles when Claude generated something that actually made me laugh out loud. A few days of "just one more thing" later, I had a satirical news site. Oops..

But for real, this does align with one of my themes for this year's builds: combatting misinformation. Misinformation tactics are everywhere, and most people can't name them. Slop Bucket uses humor (or my attempt at it) to make those tactics visible. Every article is absurd on purpose, but we dissect WHY it's absurd in the post-article "Sloptopsy". Each article includes a breakdown of the misinformation tactics used: the logical fallacies, the emotional manipulation, the rhetorical sleight of hand. Satire that teaches you to spot the real thing.


### The Build

The core is a procedural generator that randomizes dimensions to produce article prompts for me:
- **Formats:** listicle, explainer, open letter, etc.
- **Archetypes:** the LinkedIn Lunatic, the Reply Guy, the Podcast Bro, the Trad Wife, etc.
- **Subjects:** crypto, therapy speak, hustle culture, Gandalf, etc
- **Logical fallacies:** strawmen, survivorship bias, false equivalence, appeal to authority, etc.
- **Constraints:** required phrases, emotional beats, perspective voices.

The math: 300 subjects × 69 archetypes × 99 constraints × 34 fallacies × 19 formats ≈ 15 billion unique combinations. Plenty of slop to go around. But now that I have 15 billion, it doesn't feel like enough. So, I also built a trending headlines pipeline that scrapes NewsAPI for headlines and identifies topical subjects, extracts satirizable angles, and feeds them into the generator. The headlines that I choose and write for have their new variables added to the generator, constantly feeding the beast.

The site itself is basic Eleventy static site with a 90s OS browser chrome aesthetic, deployed via GitHub Pages.
