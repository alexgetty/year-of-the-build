## About Slop Bucket

[PLACEHOLDER: Why you're building this. What itch does it scratch? What made you want to make fun of the information landscape?]

### The Pitch

The name makes everyone assume AI slop. The content says otherwise.

Slop Bucket is satirical news played completely straight—the gravitas is the joke. We're holding a mirror up to thought leadership, dead journalism, and the hot take economy, making it absurd enough that people might notice how absurd it already is.

[PLACEHOLDER: Expand on what makes this different from other satire sites. The Onion comparison? The 90s aesthetic angle?]

### The Build

[PLACEHOLDER: Tech stack details. Static HTML/CSS to start? The prompt generator system with archetypes, subjects, and constraints?]

### What's Working

[PLACEHOLDER: Early wins. The headline generator? The aesthetic direction? Anything that's clicked?]

### What's Next

[PLACEHOLDER: Roadmap. Launch timeline? Stretch goals like draggable windows, easter eggs in the OS layer?]
