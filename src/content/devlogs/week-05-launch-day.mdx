## We Shipped

Mythical launched on Thursday. By Saturday, we had:
- 500+ unique users
- 12,000+ creatures generated
- #3 on Product Hunt
- Front page of Hacker News (briefly)

## What Went Right

### The Share Loop
Creature cards were designed to be shared. That bet paid off. 40% of traffic came from Twitter shares.

### The "One More" Effect
Average session length: 8 minutes. People kept clicking "generate" to see what they'd get next.

### The Name
"Mythical" is memorable and relevant. Good domain was available. Lucky.

## What Went Wrong

### Rate Limiting Was Too Aggressive
Initial limit of 10/hour frustrated power users. Bumped it to 25/hour on day two.

### Mobile Layout Broke
Tested on iPhone, forgot about Android. The creature cards overflowed on smaller screens. Hotfixed at 11 PM.

### Didn't Have Accounts Ready
Multiple requests for "how do I save my creatures?" Had to reply with "coming soon" repeatedly.

## Project 2 Starts Now

Mythical is in maintenance mode. Time to start Pocket Greenhouse—a plant care app that doesn't suck.

First month: complete. Eleven to go.
