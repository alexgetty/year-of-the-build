## Welcome to Year of the Build

Hello, world.

Well, since this is my first post and I'm not inhereting a large online following, let me address my likely audience for this first post: Hello, mom!

Welcome to Year Of The Build, my experiment where I am going to epically and publically burn myself out making as many cool things as I possibly can within 2026.

Some of these things may be commercial products I hope to make a profit from, others will be passion projects, fun experiments, or open source tools for the community. I've intentionally not planned this all out yet so I can respond to trends throughout the year.

### What to expect
- Devlogs documenting my progress as I build. I'll share details of the projects I'm working on, talk about some of the challenges or wins, and pick a few topics to go a bit deeper into if possible.
- I'll be building multiple concurrent projects at any given time.
