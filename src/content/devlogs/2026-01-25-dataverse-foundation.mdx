Dataverse is an artificial life simulation. The goal: create a substrate where entities can emerge, evolve, and exhibit genuinely surprising behaviors. Not scripted creatures following my rules, but self-organizing systems that discover their own strategies for survival and reproduction.

No code exists yet. This first phase has been entirely about documentation and research. Figuring out what to build before building it.

## The Documentation-First Approach

I've been assembling a knowledge base in Obsidian covering the foundational concepts. Particles, entities, genomes, development mechanics, membranes, energy systems. Each concept links to others, building up a web of dependencies and design decisions.

The decisions matter more than the concepts. Twelve of them so far, each with explicit rationale and tracked dependencies:
- Four-symbol genetic alphabet (simplicity wins)
- Template-based addressing for signals
- CPPN vs L-Systems for morphological encoding (spoiler: neither alone is adequate)
- Closure under mutation requirements

That last one, closure under mutation, is the kind of thing that sounds academic until you realize it determines whether your simulation can actually evolve or just randomly break.

## The Research Rabbit Hole

I've been processing research reports on genetic encoding, culminating in a decision to use a 4-layer NEAT+CPPN architecture. The research covered encoding locality (why locality trumps compactness), graph grammars for modular structures, damage tolerance mechanisms, and speciation for protecting innovations.

Reference material keeps expanding: Karl Sims' 1994 paper on evolved virtual creatures, physical reservoir computing, Integrated Information Theory, philosophy of mind from panpsychism to functionalism. The Obsidian graph is getting dense.

The research workflow now has structure: inbox for incoming reports, outbox for generated research prompts, archives for processed material. Four new research prompts are queued up covering graph grammar locality, minimum viable entities, body-brain separation, and damage tolerance in gene regulatory networks.

## What's Next

Still in research mode. The documentation needs to reach a critical mass where the implementation path becomes obvious, or at least defensible. There's a reason I'm reading about Integrated Information Theory and Landauer's principle before writing a single line of simulation code.

The knowledge graph grows denser every day. The codebase remains empty. This is fine.
