Nearly 800 tests, 100% coverage, 34 commits, and some poultry in a food graph.

## Documentation First

Wrote docs before code. Architecture decisions, provider interfaces, MCP schemas. All in markdown where mistakes are cheap. By implementation time, the system was already designed.

The key abstraction: GraphCore as orchestration hub. Every provider (storage, embeddings, vectors) plugs in through clean interfaces. Swap DocStore for Neo4j? Same API. Swap Transformers.js for OpenAI? Same API.

## SQLite Everything

DocStore caches nodes, embeddings, and centrality in SQLite. File watcher syncs Obsidian edits in under 2 seconds. Wiki-links resolve to full paths automatically.

Vector search is brute-force cosine similarity. For fewer than 200 nodes, this is fine. The architecture supports real vector DBs later.

## MCP Server

Ten tools: semantic search, graph traversal, CRUD, tag filtering. All with input validation, bounded output, and content truncation by context.

The big win: metadata-only responses by default. Search results dropped from ~16k tokens to ~2k. Claude doesn't need full documents to answer "what's related to X."

## Red Team Everything

Every phase ended with an audit. Flaky watcher tests got rewritten with callback synchronization instead of polling. 10 runs, zero flakes.

## What's Next

npm-ready but not published. Need to battle-test on a real vault and write end-user docs.
