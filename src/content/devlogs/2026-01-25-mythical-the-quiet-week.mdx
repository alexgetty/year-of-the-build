## The Absence of Work

Not much happened on Mythical this week. After the testing marathon and billing fixes from last week, I needed a breather. The codebase is in a decent spot. E2E tests are running, calendar sync is reliable, Stripe is telling the truth about what people pay.

Sometimes you just need to let something sit for a bit.

## What's Actually Happening

Honestly, my attention has been elsewhere. The Sousi stack started pulling at me again: the food knowledge graph work I've been avoiding because it's genuinely hard. And there's been some infrastructure work on the YOTB site itself that needed attention.

Mythical isn't abandoned. It's just... paused. The core functionality works. The tests pass. No fires to put out.

## The Plan

Next priority is probably user feedback infrastructure. The app is technically usable, but I have no idea if it's actually useful until someone other than me tries to use it for real. Need to figure out how to get that feedback loop going without being obnoxious about it.

But that's a problem for next week.
