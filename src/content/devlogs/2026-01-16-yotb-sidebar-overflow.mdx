## I just don't feel connected to you...

Every piece of content on this site relates to other pieces. Devlogs belong to projects. Digests aggregate devlogs from a week accross projects. Projects accumulate devlogs over time. Navigating these relationships meant going back to index pages and hunting. But, just like the Hive in Pluribus, there's been a joining.

Built out bidirectional linking across all content types:
- Project pages now show their devlogs and any digests that mention them
- Devlog sidebars show which digest they appear in
- Digest sidebars list the week's devlogs with project tags

But, as our current economic systems have shown us, unrestricted growth within a finite space leads to problems. As content grows, showing everything becomes scroll hell, so like any sane creator, I implemented limits. Projects now cap at 5 devlogs + 3 digests with "View all" links. It's probably a bit preemtive given the amount of content, but I want to get this site in a place where I don't have to keep coming back an updating it.


## Let there be light(box)

New MDX component for images with sidebar placement. Drop a `<Figure>` in content, set `placement="sidebar"`, and it renders in the margin via React portal. Falls back to inline on mobile.

Also added a Lightbox for galleries—click to expand, keyboard nav, the works. Project pages auto-populate with images from their associated devlogs (matched by file prefix). Nice to have project galleries without manually curating them.


## Hero Mobile Fix

The "latest devlog" block in the hero had a layout bug on mobile—link stretched full width, positioning hacks piled on positioning hacks. Frickin' embarrassing.
