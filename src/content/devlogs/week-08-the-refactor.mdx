## Technical Debt Comes Due

Three weeks of "I'll fix it later" caught up with me. The component library was a mess:
- 47 components, half of them unused
- No consistent naming convention
- Props that didn't make sense
- CSS that fought with itself

## The Nuclear Option

I deleted the entire `/components` folder and started over.

Sounds dramatic. Took 4 hours to rebuild what mattered. The stuff I deleted? Didn't need it.

## The New Structure

```
/components
  /atoms     (Button, Input, Icon)
  /molecules (PlantCard, WateringBadge)
  /organisms (PlantList, AddPlantForm)
  /layouts   (AppShell, OnboardingFlow)
```

Atomic design. Boring. Works.

## What I Kept

- All the business logic (hooks, utilities)
- The Supabase integration
- The notification system
- User-facing copy

## What I Rebuilt

- Every visual component
- The styling approach (moved to CSS modules)
- The prop interfaces (stricter TypeScript)

## Was It Worth It?

Yes. Adding new features is 3x faster now. The codebase makes sense again.

## Lesson Learned

Refactor early. The longer you wait, the more painful it gets.

## Next Week

Final push for February launch. Features are frozen. Polish only.
