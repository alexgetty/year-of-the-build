## The Problem

Last week's creature outputs were... inconsistent. Some were genuinely creative. Others were generic fantasy tropes. A few were just nonsense.

## What I Tried

### Attempt 1: Simple prompts
"Generate a mythological creature" produced boring results. Too generic.

### Attempt 2: Structured prompts
Adding specific fields helped, but the output felt formulaic.

### Attempt 3: Few-shot examples
This was the breakthrough. By including 3-4 examples of what I wanted, the output quality jumped dramatically.

## The Winning Formula

```
You are a mythologist creating unique creatures. Each creature should feel like it could exist in real folklore.

[3 example creatures with detailed lore]

Now create a new creature with:
- Name (invented, not from existing mythology)
- Origin region and culture
- Core abilities (2-3)
- Weakness
- A short origin myth (2-3 sentences)
```

## Visual Progress

Also made headway on the procedural visuals. Using SVG patterns with randomized color palettes. It's not art, but it's distinctive.

## Next Week

Building the share functionality. Want users to be able to generate shareable creature cards.
