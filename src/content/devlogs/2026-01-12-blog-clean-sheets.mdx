import { Figure } from '../../components/Figure/Figure';

Yesterday's devlog covered the fun stuff: implicit hub pages, graph visualizations, the flashy features. Today was about paying down the technical debt I left in my wake before it compounds.

## Component Extraction

Pulled four reusable patterns out of scattered implementations:

- **PostListItem**: The date/title/tags row that appears in condensed posts, folder contents, and tag pages. Was copy-pasted with slight variations everywhere.
- **TagLink**: The `#topic` rendering with consistent styling to replace five different implementations.
- **TopicsList**: Comma-separated tag lists for topic clouds and tag indexes.
- **SectionHeader**: Conditional h2/span labels with optional links. Another pattern that kept getting reinvented.

Not exciting, but now there's one source of truth instead of six.

## I reverse frankensteined my CSS

- Replaced 117 margin/padding reset declarations
- Consolidated 5+ duplicated unstyled-link patterns
- Removed every `!important` flag by fixing specificity properly. No wonder I slept horribly last night.
- Deleted ~300 lines of duplicated or dead CSS
- Extracted the 228-line inline SiteHeader CSS to its own file. I really don't like Obsidian's approach to css

The codebase actually got smaller while gaining structure.

## Polish

Small stuff that rounds out the day:
- Fixed graph hover bug where label backgrounds weren't scaling with text
- Reordered homepage sections (Latest post before Topics now)
- Made post list items fully clickable (date and title in one link, not separate)

## Next

I guess I actually have to start writing content now, huh?
