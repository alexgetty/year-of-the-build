## Expanding the Roster

More project pages this week. The project template has been getting exercised enough now that I can feel where it flexes well and where it binds. Adding new projects is mostly mechanical: drop in the frontmatter, fill the sections, add to the registry. The registry step keeps tripping me up. Might be time to derive that from the content collection instead of maintaining a separate JSON file.

Slop Bucket's page went through a few iterations as I figured out how to frame procedural misinformation generation. The tags and description kept shifting until they actually described what the project does rather than what it sounds like it might do.


## Devlog Backlog Cleared

Devlogs for other projects landed this week. Mythical's testing saga, Slop Bucket's launch story, GettyNet's counter service. The weekly digest (week 3) pulled them together.

Having a critical mass of devlogs exposes patterns. The sidebar linking from last week pays dividends now. Navigating between related content feels natural rather than archaeological.


## Small Fixes, Big Relief

Typos in previous devlogs got cleaned up. "Preemtive" became "preemptive." "Accross" became "across." The content authorship guidelines in the project docs got clarified too. Distinction between supervised drafting and autonomous generation matters when you're running a site like this.

Projects now sort by launch status on the index page. Launched projects float to the top; works-in-progress settle below. Small thing, but it makes the projects page feel less like a junk drawer.
