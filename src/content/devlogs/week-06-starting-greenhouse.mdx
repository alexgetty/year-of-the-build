## New Month, New Project

Mythical taught me about AI integration and viral loops. February's project is different: a utility app that needs to feel reliable and personal.

Pocket Greenhouse is a plant care companion. The goal: help people who want plants but keep killing them.

## Why This Idea?

I kill plants. I've killed succulents—supposedly impossible. I've killed a cactus. A *cactus*.

Every plant app I've tried is either:
- Too complicated (50 fields to add a plant)
- Too generic (same watering schedule for everything)
- Too ugly (designed by people who hate plants)

## Week 1 Progress

### Tech Stack
- Astro for the frontend (islands architecture is perfect here)
- Supabase for auth and database
- TailwindCSS for styling
- PWA for mobile experience

### Data Model
```
Plant
  - name
  - species
  - location
  - wateringFrequency
  - lastWatered
  - healthStatus
  - notes
```

Started simple. Will add complexity as needed.

### UI Explorations
Experimenting with a warm, organic color palette. Greens and terracottas. No cold tech vibes—this should feel like a greenhouse, not a dashboard.

## Next Week

Building the core watering reminder logic. The tricky part: making notifications helpful without being annoying.
