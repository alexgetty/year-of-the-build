## Launch Day is Thursday

Three days out. The todo list went from 47 items to 12. Progress.

## What Got Cut

You can't ship everything. Here's what didn't make v1:

- User accounts (launching as anonymous-first)
- Collection saving (coming in week 2)
- Weekly challenges (coming in week 3)
- Mobile app (maybe never)

## What Got Polished

### Performance
Reduced initial bundle size from 450KB to 180KB. Lazy loading the heavy SVG library made a huge difference.

### Accessibility
Added proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. The creature cards now read their full lore aloud.

### Analytics
Set up PostHog for basic usage tracking. Want to know which creature types get shared most.

## Marketing Prep

- Wrote the Product Hunt launch post
- Created demo GIFs for Twitter
- Drafted the Reddit posts for r/webdev and r/AIart
- Prepared the Hacker News submission

## Nerves

I've shipped things before, but this feels different. It's public. It's documented. There's nowhere to hide.

Thursday. Let's go.
