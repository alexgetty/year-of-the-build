## The Problem

Did informal user testing with 5 friends. Results:
- 2 completed onboarding and added plants
- 3 gave up during onboarding

That's a 60% drop-off. Unacceptable.

## Why They Quit

### Too Many Fields
The "add plant" form had 12 fields. Most weren't required, but they looked required. Intimidating.

### No Quick Win
Nothing satisfying happened after signing up. No dopamine hit.

### Jargon
"Watering frequency in days" confused non-plant people. "How often should I water this?" would've been clearer.

## The Fixes

### Simplified Onboarding
New flow:
1. Pick a plant photo
2. Give it a name
3. Done

Everything else is optional and revealed progressively.

### Instant Gratification
After adding your first plant, you get a little celebration animation and your first "care tip." Feels good.

### Plain Language
Replaced all jargon with conversational copy. "Water every 7 days" → "Likes a drink once a week."

## Results

Tested again with 3 new people. All completed onboarding. All added at least 2 plants.

Still not perfect, but the trajectory is right.

## Next Week

The great refactor. The codebase is getting messy. Time to clean up before it becomes unmanageable.
