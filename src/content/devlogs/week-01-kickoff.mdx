## Welcome to Year of the Build

This is it. 12 projects in 12 months. Public accountability log starts now.

### What I Built This Week

- Set up the YOTB site with Astro
- Configured React and MDX integrations
- Created content collections for devlogs and projects
- Built basic page structure (home, devlogs, projects, about)
- Added newsletter signup placeholder for Beehiiv

### Technical Stack

The site is intentionally minimal:

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **React** for interactive components (hydrated only when needed)
- **MDX** for content (this devlog is MDX!)
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **Beehiiv** for newsletter

### Next Week

- Start working on Project #1
- Set up actual Beehiiv embed
- Write the first real devlog

### Why This Matters

I've spent too much time in tutorial hell. Too much planning, not enough shipping.
This is the antidote: build something real every month, document it publicly, and stay accountable.

No excuses. Just builds.
