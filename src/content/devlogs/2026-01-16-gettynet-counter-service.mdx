## I feel vindicated

Well, Gettynet is officially multi-project! Prior to this devlog, I had set up a few endpoints for TRKR, but as of today Gettynet has been validated as a useful tool across projects.

I needed to build a 90s-style "visitor counter" for the cringe-inducing Slop Bucket site, and rather than relying on some 3rd-party API, I just rolled my own. Not having to spin up an entirely new backend for a dead-simple gimmick feature felt great.

## Oh, also

This log technically includes the failed spotify integration I mentioned in my last TRKR devlog. I'd rather not relive that waste of time, but for the sake of being thorough and honest, here we are. Now go away.
