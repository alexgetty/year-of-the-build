## It Works

The creature generator is functional. Click button, get creature. The basic loop is satisfying.

But "functional" isn't enough. I want it to feel magical.

## Polish Items This Week

### Rate Limiting
Added proper rate limiting to prevent API abuse. Using a token bucket algorithm—users get 10 generations per hour, refilling at 1 per 6 minutes.

### Loading States
The AI takes 2-3 seconds to respond. Added a "summoning" animation with particle effects. Makes the wait feel intentional rather than broken.

### Error Handling
When the AI fails (network issues, content filters), we now gracefully fall back to a "mystical interference" message instead of a generic error.

## Share Cards

The shareable creature cards are done. Each one includes:
- The creature's name and origin
- A visual representation
- A QR code linking back to Mythical

Early testing shows people love sharing weird creatures on Twitter.

## Next Week

Final push before launch. Bug fixes, performance optimization, and preparing marketing materials.
