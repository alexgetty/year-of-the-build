After yesterday's CSS massacre, a couple rough edges were still bugging me.

## Post Headers

The title styling was leaking scope and messing with things it shouldn't. Consolidated the post header components while fixing the CSS containment.

## Graph Hover States

The force-directed graph had a subtle visual bug: when hovering nodes, the text label exceeded it's fill container, cutting off the first and last letter. Now, it... doesn't do.. that.

Small steps. Not every day needs to be huge, but every day matters.
