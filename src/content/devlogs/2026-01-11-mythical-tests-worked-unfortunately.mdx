As I mentioned before, one of my biggest sources of anxiety with creating a public project that will need regular updates/deployments was testing. The idea of having to manually run through and test every function of the app to avoid regressions was... not ideal.

Instead, I commited to doing this right and started implementing an ambitiously comprehensive E2E testing suite and automations to run them when needed.

## Infrastructure

Playwright-based E2E framework with docker-compose for isolated testing. Mocked Google Calendar API so tests don't need real OAuth, because after many attempts, I ragequit that endeavor. CI restructured: fast checks (lint, types, unit) on all branch commits, full test suite only on PRs to main.

## The Coverage

38 tests passing across 5 suites:
- Onboarding flow (redirect logic, step navigation, completion)
- Event type management (modal, creation, validation)
- Booking flows
- Double-booking prevention
- Smoke tests

23 tests still on the list. Work in progress. This was a lot. I really tried to wrap this up before this week was over, but it's now 11PM on Sunday night and it's time to call it for now.

## The Problem

Tests correctly identified a booking-calendar sync integrity bug. Low severity during the current soft-launch, but needs fixing before real users show up. Documented it, and plan to tackle these fixes after I finish up this massive testing branch and get it merged.

The whole point was to catch issues before they became production fires that cause real users to abandon. Mission accomplished, I guess. Grumble.
