Despite having multiple other "real" projects in the works, I still can't prevent myself from [procrastiworking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZbqJxQJ5LY) on the YOTB site itself. And you know what? I'm not going to apologize for it.


## New Components

- ActivityGrid: Custom GitHub contribution graph built at build-time via GraphQL API. Container queries make it responsive (12/6/3 months depending on space). Replaces the old external image embed.
- DigestCard: Digest cards got their own styling (forest green vs. devlog amber), timeline view, and month-based sidebar navigation. Each digest now shows aggregated project tags from devlogs in that week.


## Information Architecture

- Implemented two-way linking between projects and devlogs: Devlogs now show which project they belong to (sidebar card), projects now list their devlogs. 
- Added breadcrumbs to all internal pages, standardized page headers
- Introduced a `featured` flag for homepage project curation instead of hardcoding slug exclusions.
- Increased limit of devlogs on homepage from 3 to 6
- Moved about page copy into markdown for easier editing. Centralized site copy (descriptions, taglines, empty states) into `src/lib/copy.ts` for single-source-of-truth management.


## Visual Cleanup

- Stripped out decorative elements that were competing with content: gradient blobs in the body area, the triangular header decorations.
- Tightened spacing and sizing consistency across the board, especially on mobile where everything felt too padded.
- Intro stat boxes became clickable links to projects, digests, and devlog indexes
- Responsive fixes: breaking layout prevention, footer spacing, container padding normalization, mobile nav consolidation... The "wow, this looks like shit on my phone" circuit I always put off despite claiming I am an advocate of mobile-first design.
